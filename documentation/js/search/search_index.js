The most common response to “how’s the job search going?” Usually, a loud, lengthy groan.                At Collabera, we reach out a hand to turn the search into a companionable, supportive journey. A journey that certainly doesn’t inspire groaning, and one that no one ever takes alone.                Our supportive employee network helps place talented professionals at innovative companies across the world, providing continuous support for both client and consultant throughout the length of each project.                We’re the seekers, the hunters, the pacers of pavements, wearing holes in our proverbial shoes looking for the perfect person for the project, the perfect project for the person.                At Collabera, the job isn’t where the journey starts. The job is where the dreaming turns a corner. We’re the page where a story comes to life.
